# Writing Good Documentation

## Step 1 - Using Codeblocks

Good cloud engineers will use Codeblocks to make it easy for other engineers to read, copy, paste their code.  

Format codeblocks by using three backticks (`)

Sample Python code

```
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name, breed):
        self.name = name
        self.breed = breed

    def bark(self):
        print(self.name + " says Woof!")

my_dog = Dog("Buddy", "Golden Retriever")
my_dog.bark()
```

Even better you should use color coding to highlight syntax and make your code easier to read.  Simply include a language spec with your codeblock:

```python
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name, breed):
        self.name = name
        self.breed = breed

    def bark(self):
        print(self.name + " says Woof!")

my_dog = Dog("Buddy", "Golden Retriever")
my_dog.bark()
```



## Step 2 - posting images

## Step 3 - Using Github Flavored Markdown Task Lists
